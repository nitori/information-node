    "[b]What is an information node?[/b] "+\
    "Information nodes simply store "+\
    "data and share it amongst themselves when linked with each other "+\
    "according "+\
    "read/write access over encrypted connections ("+\
    "creating an autonomous data sharing cloud, similar to e.g. "+\
    "syncthing). This data usually cannot be accessed directly, " +\
    "it is hidden in a binary blob optimized for fast access "+\
    "and possibly encrypted - therefore, think of it"+\
    " as something similar to git's bare repository if you want.\n\n"+\
    "[b]What sort of data does an information node store?[/b] "\
    "Nodes are meant to store any sort of data you might have, like "+\
    "e-mail, Instant Messaging, personal file cloud etc. Unlike "+\
    "other synchronisation tools like rsync, dropbox, syncthing, " +\
    "seafile, .. it is NOT specifically limited "+\
    "to files only but includes abstract objects that can also "+\
    "model messages/e-mails/.. and tools to manage them.\n\n"+\
    "[b]Why not just use plain files?[/b] " +\
    "Information nodes allow non-file contents like e-mails, chat "+\
    "messages to be stored. It can also sync all stored files, e-mails, "+\
    "... to other nodes and encrypt them, giving you a true distributed " +\
    "cloud setup with one simple command line tool.\n\n"+\
    "[b]Where is the data of a node stored?[/b] " +\
    "It is all stored in the given node folder (see commands below)." +\
    " Nothing is stored outside except some basic preferences for " +\
    "the graphical node contents viewer if you use that one. " +\
    "The data is only shared exactly in the fashion specified by "+\
    "you, and if you want also encrypted.\n\n"+\
    "[b]How do I access and look at the data, or add new data?[/b] "+\
    "If you just want to browse the data and possibly do minor "+\
    "modifications, use the information node client (separate binary) "+\
    "to access and review"+\
    " the data in a specific node and manually edit it (like you would" +\
    " read e-mails in an e-mail client). "+\
    "To use an information node as automated communication relay with "+\
    "regular protocols (e-mail, IM), look at [b]enable-gateway[/b] below "+\
    "which allows an information node to be used as an [b]e-mail client[/b]"+\
    ", [b]XMPP chat client[/b] and much more."+\
    " Remember, you can always sync everything with other nodes too, and "+\
    "look and interact with it using the viewer."+\
    " A file gateway also allows you to map your files to a regular "+\
    "folder on your disk to have your own private dropbox/syncthing/btsync "+\
    "equivalent.\n\n"+\
    "[b]Why should I use this?[/b] " +\
    "If you would like something like Dropbox or Syncthing for your "+\
    "e-mail or Instant Messaging messages too, this tool is for you. "+\
    "If you want to have something like Syncthing but with remote nodes "+\
    "that only provide backup locations and are fully encrypted without "+\
    "the secure decryption key ever being on the remote location, this is"+\
    " for you as well.\n\n" +\
    "[b]Is this system secure?[/b] "+\
    "Information nodes use strong RSA-based PGP async encryption for "+\
    "identification and communication, and with [b]encrypt-for-target[/b]"+\
    " (see below) you can have data in your cloud that cannot be "+\
    "decrypted by any of the nodes which store it " +\
    "except for some specified local one which can be "+\
    "safe on your local laptop - however, even your laptop can be "+\
    "compromised and software, including this one, has bugs. "+\
    "Remember, one rogue node with write access can do a lot of damage. "+\
    "So while we hope it helps you to securely share your data, don't "+\
    "trust it too much.\n\n" +\
    "[b]What happens about data loss?[/b] "+\
    "There is versioning support (configurable through the client) which "+\
    "should help against file corruption, "+\
    "and if you have enough nodes to distribute the data you should be "+\
    "fine if one of them dies. If you fear you will lose the only node "+\
    "being able to decrypt some of your data as per "+\
    "[b]encrypt-for-target[/b], use [b]export-identity[/b] (see below) " +\
    "to backup its private key."+\
    "[b]How do I get started?[/b] "+\
    "Create a node (see the action [b]node[/b] below), then get the "+\
    "information node client (either cli version or graphical) and open "+\
    "it to add/review data. "+\
    "Later on, add and link remote nodes as you see fit.",

parser.add_argument("action",
    help=textwrap.dedent('''\
        Specify the action to be executed:

        [b]"node" <node-folder> [<[interface:]port>][/b] - create or
        re-enable the
        node at the given folder location, and optionally allow
        remote access from other nodes (see "link" below) through the given
        listen interface.

        [b]"fingerprint" <node-folder>[/b] - show the fingerprint of the
        node stored at the given folder. This represents the identity of this
        particular node.

        [b]"link" <target-host:target-port>[/b] - connect to a remote
        node. Please note that unless "allow-read" or "allow-write" (see
        below) was used to enable permissions in any direction, the nodes
        will not be able to share or access any data from each other.

        [b]"enable-read" <node-folder> <fingerprint>[/b] -
        allow the remote node with
        the given fingerprint to access all data in the local node located at
        <node-folder> with read-only permission.

        [b]"disallow-read" <node-folder> <fingerprint>[/b] - revokes read
        access to
        the local node located at <node-folder> for the remote node with the
        given fingerprint.

        [b]"allow-write" <node-folder> <fingerprint>[/b] - allow the
        remote node with
        the given fingerprint to add data to the local node located at
        <node-folder>. Please note this does NOT mean it can also access any
        data - see "allow-read" to allow that.

        [b]"disallow-write" <node-folder> <fingerprint>[/b] - revokes
        write access to
        the local node located at <node-folder> for the remote node with the
        given fingerprint.

        [b]"enable-encrypt-password" <node-folder> <password>[/b] -
        as soon as any data arrives which needs to be saved to disk, encrypt
        it with the given password as a key. Please note the password should
        be rather lengthy and random if you want to withstand brute-force
        decryption of an attacker getting somehow access to your encrypted
        information node storage contents on disk. The encryption is set up
        to be asymmetric, so you'll never need to submit the password just to
        start the node later or to add in more encrypted items - it will just
        be required to decrypt items.
        [b]SECURITY NOTICE:[/b] some
        very basic metadata like time of creation and a random id
        will still remain unencrypted for each data part to enable the
        syncing protocol
        to operate properly.

        [b]"disable-encrypt-password" <node-folder> <password>[/b] -
        disable the encryption with a password again. Please note decryption
        all the items might take some time, so this command can take a while
        to complete. If the information node is terminated before this command
        completes, simply issue it again to make sure everything is decrypted.

        [b]"enable-encrypt-node-target" <node-folder> <fingerprint> <cert>[/b]
        -
        as soon as any data arrives at this node from another node or from
        an information gateway, encrypt it before it gets written to disk
        in a way that allows decryption only with the private key
        information possessed and stored
        with the node identified by <fingerprint> (which can run on any
        other computer in this world - and doesn't need to be directly
        linked).
        The node can and will still share the data with others according to
        the specified read/write access and remote links, but no node
        including
        this node itself will be able to decrypt the contents.
        Only if the specified target node ever obtains them, it will be
        able to decrypt and actually read it.
        The <cert> file needs to be obtained and provided manually from the
        given target node (where it can be exported with [b]export-cert[/b])
        for technical reasons - it will be verified to match
        the fingerprint, so it should be safe to obtain it over insecure
        ways if you need to. Publishing the <cert> file won't give an attacker
        access to the data - however, publishing the file system contents of
        the target node's local storage folder will.
        [b]SECURITY NOTICE:[/b] some
        very basic metadata like time of creation and a random id
        will still remain unencrypted for each data part to enable the
        syncing protocol
        to operate properly.

        [b]"disable-encrypt-node-target"[/b] <node-folder> -
        disables the node-target encryption - but only for newly added
        items. This is because only the target node has the information to
        decrypt anything again, so it is impossible for this node to do this.
        Only if there is a sychronization from the target node for the
        encryption to this
        one, the files will be gradually synchronized back to an unencrypted
        state at this node.


        [b]"enable-gateway" <node-folder> <gateway-name> <options>[/b]
        - enable an automated gateway and provide the given set of
        options which are
        gateway specific. (to know which options a gateway wants to have,
        see [b]gateway-info[/b] below)
        If you don't specify any options and the gateway was temporarily
        stopped, it will relaunch with the last specified set of options.
        [b]SECURITY NOTICE:[/b] the options will
        be stored inside the <node-folder> location [b]including
        passwords[/b] as plain text which some gateways require.

        [b]"gateway-info" <node-folder> <gateway-name>[/b] -
        print out whether this gateway
        is currently enabled, and what sort of options it accepts in general.
        [b]Omit the gateway name to list all available gateways.[/b]

        [b]"disable-gateway" <node-folder> <gateway-name>[/b] - permanently
        disable a gateway, erasing the stored options. If you need to
        shutdown a
        gateway temporarily, simply SIGTERM the respective information-node
        daemon
        processes.

        [b]"export-cert" <node-folder> <file-to-write-to>[/b] -
        export the certificate file required for [b]encrypt-for-target[/b].
        This file can be verified with the fingerprint and it doesn't allow
        to decrypt anything, so it's rather safe to pass around.

        [b]"export-identity" <node-folder> <file-to-write-to>[/b] -
        this exports the
        cryptographic data representing this node (beyond the fingerprint).
        You should only ever require this to backup a node that is the only
        one to be able to decrypt important files, and you should only
        store this data in some safe location. (e.g. print it out, the file
        is readable text and not that long!)
        [b]SECURITY NOTICE:[/b] This data allows you to decrypt whatever only
        this node could decrypt as per [b]encrypt-for-target[/b] and it allows
        completely impersonating this node in all communication - therefore,
        this data is [b]very sensitive[/b].

        [b]"import-identity" <node-folder> <file-to-import>[/b] -
        import the exported identity into the node stored at the given
        location. Its previous identity will be wiped, which means that its
        fingerprint will change. All data will be kept, but if the node was
        previously the only one to be able to decrypt a data as per
        [b]encrypt-for-target[/b] it will now [b]no longer be able to do so
        since that capability is linked with the cryptographic identity.[/b]
